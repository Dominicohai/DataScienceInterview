conditional problems, sometimes binomial.  There's a simple regression analysis, and a basic question on interpreting complexity of a test/training set. 

You'll also be asked to interpret an ROC graph.  Finally, you need to know what false-positive, true-positive, false-negative, and false-positive in logistic regression. You're going to be shown one and asked to explain which section is which.  Also, know what outliers are in a graph and.

The Stats interview comprises of conditional problems, sometimes binomial. There's a simple regression analysis, and a basic question on interpreting ROC curve


Python since the course is taught in the language. Finally, there could be a data science interview focusing on the theory. This interview covers the most common data science topics including frequentist stats and machine learning.

Interview Questions
How would you compare two ML models?  

There were some simple probability questions, interpreting an ROC curve and interpreting train and test error

Basic python questions. One that stuck out to me was coding an anagram detector that went through a list of words and detected which ones were anagrams.

Basic stats problems. Asked what a ROC curve was and asked to identify true positive true negative, and so on. Also asked about machine learning and training vs test accuracy.
