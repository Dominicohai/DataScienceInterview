# Python Interview

realpython: primitives
1. What are python primitives (check real python)?

1. Make a text reading program with word count, average word amount, number of sentences etc. 

2. Anagram detector that went through a list of words and detected which ones were anagrams.

3. Min max of an array


# SQL Interview Portion
1. MySQL

# Data Science Interview
1. conditional problems

2. Simple regression analysis

3. Interpreting complexity of a test/training set. 

4. Interpret an ROC Graph.

5. False-positive, true-positive, false-negative, and false-positive in logistic regression.
You're going to be shown one and asked to explain which section is which.

6. Outliers in a graph

7. Statistical knowledge, general probability, probability distributions, general stats

8. frequentist stats

9. Overfitting and things you can do to combat them. 

10. How would you compare two ML models?  

11. Interpreting train and test error. 
Asked what a ROC curve was and asked to identify true positive true negative, and so on. Also asked about machine learning and training vs test accuracy.

13. Frequentist and Bayesian Methods.

14. Structured and unstructured data sets (scikit-learn, numpy, scipy)

15. Distributions (binomial etc). 

16. Natural language processing 

17. Big Data (spark etc)

18. What is a random variable? 
A random variable X is an object that can be used to generate random numbers, in a way that valid probabilistic statements about the generated numbers can be made. 
P(X=1)= .5
P(X=1) = 1/12
P(X>6) =0
are all probabilistic statements about a random variable X. 

19. Distributions (binomial etc). 
Random variables
* Number of heads seen in ten flips of a quarter
* Number of heads seen in ten flips of a dime. 
have the same distribution

The distribution of a random variable is the pattern of all probabilities we assign to all outcomes of the random variable. So two random variables have the same distribution if they all assign the same probabilities to all possible outcomes. In this case, we  say that these random variables are equally distributed. 

<b>Discrete</b>
The binomial distribution counts discrete occurrences among discrete trials.

The poisson distribution counts discrete occurrences among a continuous domain (typically events in time). 
<b>Continuous</b>
Normal, Uniform, Exponential

20. SVM

21. Lasso and Ridge Regression

22. One sided vs two sided T test.
