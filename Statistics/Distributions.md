1. Describe a non-normal probability distribution and how to apply it.
2. Do you know the Dirichlet distribution? the multinomial distribution?
3. Explain what a long-tailed distribution is and provide three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails. Why are they important in classification and prediction problems?
4. Give examples of data that does not have a Gaussian distribution, or log-normal.
5. How would you check if a distribution is close to Normal? Why would you want to check it? What is a QQ Plot?
6. How would you find an anomaly in a distribution?
7. How would you know when Gaussian Mixture Model is applicable?
8. What is the difference between skewed and uniform distribution?
