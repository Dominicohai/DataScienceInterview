1. How does a neural network with three layers (one input layer, one inner layer and one output layer) compare to a logistic regression?
2. How would you train an ANN? 
3. What is back propagation?
4. What is deep learning? What is CNN (Convolution Neural Network) or RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)?
