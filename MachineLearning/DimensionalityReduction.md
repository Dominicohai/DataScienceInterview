1. Why standardize data? Difference between whitening and standardizing the data.
reference: pg 567 and 568 of https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732 . Need to answer this since others wont have access to the book. 
2. Are dimensionality reduction techniques supervised or not? Are all of them are (un)supervised? 
3. Do we need to normalize data for PCA? Why?
4. Why do we need to center data for PCA and what can happen if we donâ€™t do it?
5. What dimensionality reductions can be used for preprocessing the data?
6. Suppose you have a very sparse matrix where rows are highly dimensional. You project these rows on a random vector of relatively small dimensionality. Is it a valid dimensionality reduction technique or not?
7. What is the advantage of performing dimensionality reduction before fitting an SVM?
8. What is the purpose of dimensionality reduction and why do we need it?
9. Is PCA a linear model or not? Why?
10. What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis?
11. What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? Under what conditions is PCA effective? How is it related to eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)?
12. What is the relationship between Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA & QDA)
