1. Your model considers the feature X significant, and Z is not, but you expected the opposite result. How will you explain it?
2. You have a data set containing 100K rows, and 100 columns, with one of those columns being our dependent variable for a problem we'd like to solve. How can we quickly identify which columns will be helpful in predicting the dependent variable? Identify two techniques and explain them to me as though I were 5 years old.
3. Does the model affect the choice of feature selection method?
4. How Univariate feature selection works?
5. Is feature selection a dimensionality reduction technique?
6. Is there any thumb rule for the number of features that should be used? How do you select the best features?
7. What are some good ways for performing feature selection that do not involve exhaustive search?
8. What Is feature selection and its importance with examples.
9. What is the difference between feature selection and feature extraction?
10. What is variance threshold approach of feature selection?
11. What will be your approach to recursive feature elimination?
12. You fit a multiple regression to examine the effect of a particular feature. The feature comes back insignificant, but you believe it is significant. How will you explain it?
